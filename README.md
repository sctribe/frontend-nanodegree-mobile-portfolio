## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

### Part 1

#### How to Run

1. Check out the repository

2. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

3. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080

4. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok http 8080
  ```


#### Optimzations

1. Without optimizations the PageSpeed Insights scores were 27 for mobile and 29 for desktop.
2. All pictures were compressed and optimzed using ImageOptim and other processing software. Pizzeria.jpg was oversized so 
	it was resized to match the largest container it would be placed in.
3. Inlined the CSS as suggested by PageSpeed Insights. Fonts were also inlined. 
4. HTML files were all minified.
5. Added async to analytics js and moved the scripts to the bottom of the HTML file.
6. PageSpeed Insights gives a score of 96 for mobile and 95 for desktop.


###Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

In order to produce a consistent 60 FPS the following optimizations were made.

1. changePizzaSizes function was changed as shown in the course video. Created a variable for the DOM query outside of the for loop.
	This way I can use the variable without quering the DOM during each iteration of the loop. Slider value was changed to percent and
	the logic for the pizza size was simplified.
2. updatePositions function was also changed the same way as point 1. This got rid of the Forced Synchronous Layout error shown by Chrome
	Dev Tools.
3. Added will-change: transform to .mover class CSS to move background pizzas to different layer.
4. Changed the number of background pizzas from 200 to 50. Fills page the exact same way as before but loop runs faster now.

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.
